<h1>How this works</h1>
<br>
<p>PokeGAN is a generator and discriminator system where it trains itself to generate high quality pokemon cards to output. It takes in all of the pokemon cards as a png and tries to recreate something similar.</p>
<br>
<p>When you enter into the website it has already created the generated pokemon cards it needs when you ask the website for them. It should look relatively like a new pokemon card.</p>
